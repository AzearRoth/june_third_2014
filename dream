I remember I was dreaming last night.  This was a pleasant dream.  I know this because of the way I felt when I awoke.  I can't remember any details about 
the dream itself.  I can describe what happened next well.  When I awoke I felt at peace.  Calm.  Ready.  Like nothing was the matter.  I felt happy and warm.
I felt like I could handle anything.  I bit glazed over.  I had masturbated the night before.  I'm up to 48 hours.  I know my dreams were particularly calm because
of this.  
Because I cam in such a way, that I lost myself in the moment, without porn.  The masturbation I did last night, was for me.  It was about losing myself in a moment.
It wasn't about any machines.  It wasn't about any control structures.  It was about me.  It was like a celebration.  Part of the issue was, I could not name
my fear before yesterday.  I wasn't sure how much I owed in government debt.  I now know exactly how much my education cost.  And that releaves me.
